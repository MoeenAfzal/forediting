                According to Feeding America, Food security is a federal measure of a household’s ability to provide enough food for every person in the household to have an active, healthy life. Food insecurity is one way we can measure the risk of hunger. One "bad month" can be enough to plunge a household into food insecurity. Lay-offs at work, unexpected car maintenance or an accident on the job can suddenly force a family to choose between buying food and paying bills. Working families across America face countless situations that can result in food insecurity and hunger. That’s why many working families, including thousands of households who don’t qualify for federal nutrition assistance, depend on food banks and pantries like The Storehouse Project to help make ends meet during difficult times.

                Aside from maximizing our capacity to feed those in need by supplementing the food we receive from the Connecticut Food Bank, funding also enables us to maintain our vehicles and buy necessary supplies for our Stationary Pantry, Mobile Food Pantry, Community Dining Centers, and Thanksgiving Basket Distribution. In our long range plans, additional vehicles, storage space (including cold and dry good storage) will be increasingly imperative, Food insecurity is often symptomatic of many other poverty-related maladies. It is our strong desire and full intention to help move people out of the pit of poverty in as many ways as can. We’re currently considering a variety of ways to come alongside individuals to be of help in that endeavor. Support as basic as an available hot shower and washer/dryer setup to a medical clinic, legal counsel and employment counseling are being considered. In whatever direction we go, funding for facilities, training and staffing will be required.
